# Welcome to Clip4Moni

Clip4Moni manages text snippets. Text snippets are frequently used pieces of text. Instead of countless re-typing, for example, a greeting message, legal information or your address,
just choose it from a menu. The corresponding text is put on the system clipboard. Use *PASTE* in the destination application to insert the text or phrase. 

The app is released under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2. You can download native installers for Windows and macOS from the [Releases](https://github.com/tkuenneth/clip4moni/releases/latest) section.
