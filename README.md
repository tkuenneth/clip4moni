# Welcome to Clip4Moni

Clip4Moni is a small utility that manages text snippets. Text snippets are frequently used pieces of text.
Instead of countlessly re-typing, for example, a greeting message, legal information or your address,
just choose it from a small menu. The corresponding text is put on the system clipboard. Then use
*PASTE* in the destination application to have the text or phrase inserted. 

Clip4Moni was originally written in Java. Some parts have been re-written in Kotlin.

Clip4Moni is released under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.

*Note for macOS users*  
If macOS tells you that the app is damaged and should be deleted you can try to fix this by executing `xattr -cr /Applications/Clip4Moni.app` in *Terminal*.
